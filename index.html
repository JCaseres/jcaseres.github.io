            <h2>DeVry University</h2>
            <p>I attended DeVry University in 2011, two months after I graduated high school. Four years later, I received my bachelor's degree in Multimedia Design and Development, where I learned Web and Graphic Design. In those four years, I quickly fell in love with coding. I knew it was something I wanted my career to be because I quickly understood the concept of coding, and problem-solving feels excellent when you figure everything out.</p>

It taught me everything I needed to build a reliable and responsive website from the ground up. Still, because technology moves so fast today, I have to keep up with new languages and software somehow. I then found Codecademy. With their help, I learned what I was missing to become a Front End Engineer. I love creating websites, whereas incorporating sites with other techs like React, Ai, and Algorithms opens up many more ideas.</p>

            <h2>Inspirational Note Pad</h2>
            <p>
                INP (Inspirational Note Pad) stands as a monumental achievement in my journey as a developer, representing the culmination of my diligent efforts and a significant step forward in my technical prowess. This innovative application, developed using the powerful REACT framework, signifies not only the successful creation of a functional digital tool but also the embodiment of my dedication to continuous learning and growth.
                <br>
                <br>
                The inception of INP bears the distinct imprint of a decision I made after recognizing the immense potential that REACT held within the realm of web development. Curiously absent from my academic journey at DeVry, where I embarked on a four-year exploration of technology, REACT emerged as a relatively nascent framework during those times. Its adoption was limited to a select few developers who were pioneering its application within their web projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, my enthusiasm for innovation coupled with an unwavering commitment to skill enhancement compelled me to embark on a journey of self-directed learning. The catalyst for this voyage was a REACT online course I undertook on Codecademy. Fueled by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to stay at the forefront of technological trends, I delved into the intricacies of REACT with fervor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Months of rigorous study, coupled with intensive reading and hands-on experimentation, laid the groundwork for the creation of INP. Assembling the building blocks of this application required more than just technical prowess; it demanded the ability to synthesize concepts, troubleshoot challenges, and envision a cohesive user experience. Each line of code, each design element, and each interactive feature bore witness to my resolute determination to master this framework.
                <br>
                <br>
                INP, in its essence, serves as a testament to the capabilities of self-directed learning and the democratization of knowledge that online platforms offer. It symbolizes my transformation from a curious learner to a proficient creator, breathing life into a concept that was once foreign to me. This accomplishment is just the beginning, a mere glimpse of the possibilities that lie ahead.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking ahead, I'm invigorated by the prospect of not only refining and expanding INP but also embarking on the creation of more intricate, feature-rich applications. The journey continues as I immerse myself deeper into the realm of REACT, navigating its intricacies and unraveling its nuances. INP, the springboard of my aspirations, beckons me onward, urging me to explore, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

            <h2>Passport Guru</h2>
            <p>
                I had the distinct opportunity to collaborate closely with a dynamic and tightly-knit team comprised of three highly motivated individuals, all united by a shared passion for innovation and technology. Our collaborative endeavor revolved around a captivating side project that entailed the conceptualization and realization of a cutting-edge travel application.
                <br>
                <br>
                The journey we embarked upon was characterized by a meticulous and imaginative creative process, wherein we skillfully harnessed the power of industry-leading design tools such as Adobe XD and Figma. These platforms served as our canvases as we meticulously etched out a multitude of wireframes and designs, seamlessly blending the analog essence of physical notebooks with the boundless potential of digital software tools.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within this context, my distinctive role materialized as the visionary architect behind the visual articulation of specific sections nestled within the intricate tapestry of the app. I dedicated my energy and expertise to crafting intricate wireframes that not only captured the essence of our collective vision but also demonstrated the meticulous attention to detail that underpins exceptional user experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                Upon achieving a harmonious consensus on the meticulously crafted wireframes, I assumed the mantle of translating these blueprints into tangible digital realities. This transformation began with the construction of the first set of mockups, sculpting the visage of the app's inaugural landing page. A symphony of creativity and iteration ensued, as we subjected these mockups to a series of refinements and enhancements, each iteration propelling us closer to our ambitious vision.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a natural progression of this iterative process, I seized the opportunity to breathe life into our aspirations by engineering the very first fully functional prototype for the app's landing page. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Adobe XD, I infused interactive elements, seamlessly blending aesthetics with functionality. This pivotal milestone marked the transition from conceptualization to tangibility, laying a solid foundation for the immersive user experience that our team ardently aimed to deliver.
                <br>
                <br>
                In essence, our collaborative efforts coalesced into a captivating narrative of innovation, creativity, and meticulous craftsmanship. Through the convergence of diverse skills and unwavering determination, we sculpted a vision into reality, setting the stage for the journey that lay ahead in the realm of app development.

                This evolution of Torino Maintenance's website has been a symphony of innovation and adaptation.

            <h2>Equitas Brokerage Group</h2>
            <p>
                In my capacity as a dedicated web developer at Equitas, I undertook a multifaceted role that spanned the creation of captivating and functional online platforms for brokers and a diverse clientele. My proficiency encompassed a versatile array of technologies, most notably WordPress, HTML, and CSS, enabling me to orchestrate the design and development of well-structured websites that met the unique needs of each client.
                <br>
                <br>
                A cornerstone of my role involved architecting the digital landscapes of clients who embarked on their online journey from scratch, devoid of any preexisting web presence. This intricate process necessitated the meticulous formulation of comprehensive wireframes that mapped out the entire user experience and visual layout. With a deft touch, I constructed these blueprints from the ground up, ensuring that each element was strategically positioned to deliver an intuitive and engaging user journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                Upon achieving a harmonious alignment on these foundational wireframes, I embarked on the transformative journey of bringing websites to life. Leveraging my proficiency in content management systems, I harnessed the power of WordPress to craft dynamic and feature-rich websites that resonated with the client's branding and objectives. However, recognizing the diverse technological landscape, I also adeptly utilized platforms like Wix for clients who boasted an established online footprint, ensuring that the transition was seamless and aligned with their existing digital identity.
                <br>
                <br>
                A hallmark of our development process was our unwavering commitment to precision and quality.

This dynamic exchange ensured that the website not only met but exceeded the client's expectations, embodying the highest standards of design, functionality, and user experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                In essence, my tenure at Equitas was defined by the orchestration of a holistic and strategic web development process. I navigated the intricate realms of design, development, and quality assurance with an unwavering dedication to excellence. Each project undertaken was not merely a website but a testament to the fusion of technical expertise, artistic flair, and effective communication. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, I am excited by the prospect of further honing my skills and contributing to the creation of digital ecosystems that captivate, engage, and deliver exceptional value to clients and users alike.
