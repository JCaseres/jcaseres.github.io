            <h2>DeVry University</h2>
            <p>I attended DeVry University in 2011, two months after I graduated high school. 
            I received my bachelor's degree for Multimedia Design and Development where I learned Web and Graphic Design. In those four years, 
            I quickly fell in love with coding, and I knew it was something I really wanted to do because I understood everything 
            I learned when it came to coding and development.</p>

            <h2>CodeCademy</h2>
            <p>I appreciate and am thankful of all the knowledge that I gained in my 4 years at DeVry University. 
            It taught me everything needed to build a reliable, and responsive website from the ground up, 
            but because technology moves so fast today, I have to keep up with new language and software somehow. 
            Introducing CodeCademy. This is where I learned what I was missing to become a Front End Engineer. 
            I love creating websites but incorporating websites along with other tech like React, Ai, 
            and Algorithms opens up to many more ideas.</p>

            <h2>Inspirational Note Pad</h2>
            <p>INP (Inspirational Note Pad) is my first REACT application built by me after I took a REACT online course to learn the language. I was never introduced to REACT in my four years at DeVry in 2011 because REACT was still new back then, and only a few developers applied it to their sites. I took on the challenge of learning REACT through Codecademy, and after a few months of studying and reading, I finally created my first app.
            I look forward to learning more and increasing my knowledge of REACT to build bigger and better applications.</p>

            <p>Torino Maintenance is a janitorial maintenance company based out of Lodi, NJ. They provide commercial cleaning services to companies (big and small) needing a janitorial maintenance team. I worked on their website in 2012 and, over time, have helped them evolve it and update it to a more modern look with new JS animations and transitions. They use the website as a way of displaying the work they have done and a method for new customers to submit requests for new jobs.</p>
